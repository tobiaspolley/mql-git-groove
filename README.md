This project provides a bundle of BASH scripts that facilitate developing MQL applications.
It basically mimics the branching model proposed by the Git-flow project, enhancing it with some useful features:

- Synchronizing `\#property version` across all project files
- Renaming immediate source files along version numbers
- Generating release specific files
- Generating tarballs ready to deploy
